# JS | Canvas RaceCar

## Introduction

We are ready to start making some games with `canvas` help, so in this first exercise we will a **Car Race** using some basic animations we learned today.

Remember you have the Learning Units to check any concept you might need. We are working with `2D` context, so you should think the canvas is a cartesian plane, where you can move elements changing their position in any of the `axis`.

### Requirements

- [Fork this repo]()
- Clone this repo into your `~/code/labs`
- The images are also included in the repository

## 1. First iteration: Draw the Game Board

The first thing we need is to create our board. The left side of the image is already on the HTML file, but when we click on the **StartGame** button, we need to create the canvas and display our road.

The *intrisic* dimensions of the `<canvas>` **should be 1000x1600**

You should add your drawing instructions inside the `main.js` `function draw() {}`.

## 2. Second Iteration: Draw PlayerÂ´s Car

Once we have our road, we need the playerÂ´s car. On the `images` folder, you will find a `.png` file you should use for the player.

You should use the `Car` class:
- in the constructor, once image is loaded, assign `this.w`, `this.h`, `this.x` and `this.y`:
  - `this.w` should be 100 units as width
  - `this.h` should be computed thanks to `imgRatio` and `this.w`
- Then implement the `draw()` method

Once our `Car` class is ready, in `main.js` don't forget to create a new car ðŸš— when `startGame()`! Don't also forget to draw it !

## 3. Third Iteration: Make PlayerÂ´s Car move right and left

In our game, the player will only be able to move the car to the right and left. Using `left` and `right` arrows, the player should be able to move the car.

For that you should implement the 2 methods `moveLeft()` and `moveRight` of the `Car` class.

NB: Use `document.onkeydown = function (e) {...}` already defined in `main.js` to detect the key pressed.

:bulb: Remember the boundaries!

## 4. Fourth Iteration: Create Obstacles

Now letÂ´s make this interesting. We should create obstacles that shows up every certain amount of times. (Remember how we did them on the Learning Unit). In this iteration, just limit to create them :wink:

They will always start in the position **0** of the `y` axis, but you should make them appear in a random place of the `x` axis.

You should use the `Obstacle` class:
- in the `constructor()`, assign `this.w`, `this.h`, `this.x` and `this.h`
- then implement the `draw()` method

NB: Implement a utility `random(from, to)` function, to help you get random numbers for your obstacles.

## 5. Fifth Iteration: Collisions

Implement the `hits()` method into `Obstacle` class:
 - it takes the car as parameter
 - it should return a boolean wether the obstacle hits the car (or not).

NB: car hits an obstacle when car is in-between obstacle horizontally and vertically :)

Once `hits()` implemented, test it against each obstacle in `main.js`.

If one hits the car, pass `gameover` to `true` so it won't call `requestAnimationFrame` next frame, ie: stop the gameloop.

## 6. Bonus Iteration: Points, Points, Points

Oh! If we want to challenge somebody, we need to quantify who is making it better. So we need to add a **score**. Go ahead and add a method to count points while you keep the car avoiding obstacles.
